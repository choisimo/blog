## 0. 테스트 성숙도 요약
- 판정: 단위/통합 커버리지는 강하지만 production E2E와 governance/audit gates가 release 기준에서 불완전하다.
- 분석 초점: 테스트 전략
- 기준 시스템: 현재 worktree + SSH `blog` k3s + 배포 사이트 `noblog.nodove.com`/`api.nodove.com`.
- 가장 중요한 공통 위험: route-governance drift, unresolved npm audit advisories, production browser background abort symptoms.

## 1. 테스트 인벤토리
- Backend, frontend, and worker test suites passed; route governance drift and npm audit advisories remain release-blocking checks depending on policy.
- Existing `frontend/e2e/live-chat.spec.ts` stubs live endpoints; 이번 run은 별도 Playwright script로 production을 실제 호출했다.
- Route governance drift and npm audit failures are uncovered by tests but not automatically remediated.

## 2. 기능별 커버리지 매트릭스
- Backend, frontend, and worker test suites passed; route governance drift and npm audit advisories remain release-blocking checks depending on policy.
- Existing `frontend/e2e/live-chat.spec.ts` stubs live endpoints; 이번 run은 별도 Playwright script로 production을 실제 호출했다.
- Route governance drift and npm audit failures are uncovered by tests but not automatically remediated.

권장 작업:
1. production smoke E2E를 CI 또는 scheduled synthetic check로 승격한다.
2. route governance drift를 failing required check로 유지한다.
3. npm audit allowlist/patch SLA를 정한다.

## 3. 불변식 기반 테스트 공백
| Severity | Risk | Evidence | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| High | Route governance snapshot drift | `npm run routes:check` failed | Fix source/snapshot drift before contract docs/release. |
| High | Production dependency advisories | npm audit backend/frontend failed | Patch or document temporary allowlist with expiry. |
| Medium | Production browser background aborts | Playwright failedRequests/console entries | Add cancellation-aware handling and dedicated E2E. |
| Medium | Cloudflared lifecycle/origin reachability history | SSH cloudflared logs | Upgrade cloudflared and alert on origin/DNS failures. |
| Medium | Restore/DR not proven | No restore drill executed | Run non-prod restore drills. |

## 4. 추천 테스트 설계
| Gate | Result | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Deployed frontend HTTP | PASS | `https://noblog.nodove.com/` returned 200. |
| Deployed backend health/readiness | PASS | API readiness reported all required dependencies ok. |
| SSH backend connectivity | PASS | `ssh blog` reached host; k3s blog namespace inspected. |
| Browser E2E | PASS with residual symptoms | Main pages rendered; background aborts observed for RUM, analytics view, comments stream, translation, RAG during navigation. |
| Backend tests | PASS | 0 failures, 1 Redis integration skip. |
| Frontend typecheck/tests | PASS | TypeScript and Vitest passed. |
| Worker tests | PASS | Non-fatal workerd DNS warning. |
| Contract drift | PASS | `contracts:check` snapshot current. |
| Route governance | FAIL | `routes:check` reports route-governance snapshot drift. |
| npm audit backend | FAIL advisory gate | 8 prod advisories, high/moderate. |
| npm audit frontend | FAIL advisory gate | 29 prod advisories including critical/high. |

검증/운영 권장:
- Release gate에 `contracts:check`, `routes:check`, backend/frontend/worker tests, production smoke E2E, npm audit triage를 포함한다.
- Rollback 기준은 readiness degradation, 5xx spike, route boundary header mismatch, queue/DLQ growth, client E2E failure로 둔다.
- Incident triage는 public API readiness -> k3s pod status -> cloudflared logs -> queue/outbox stats 순서로 수행한다.

## 핵심 Findings
- Backend, frontend, and worker test suites passed; route governance drift and npm audit advisories remain release-blocking checks depending on policy.
- Existing `frontend/e2e/live-chat.spec.ts` stubs live endpoints; 이번 run은 별도 Playwright script로 production을 실제 호출했다.

2. route governance drift를 failing required check로 유지한다.
3. npm audit allowlist/patch SLA를 정한다.

## 미확인 및 잔여 리스크
- 실제 운영 데이터에 대한 destructive write/delete/restore drill은 실행하지 않았다.
- Admin-authenticated browser E2E, real comment mutation, file upload mutation, billing flow는 이 run에서 실행하지 않았다.
- npm audit advisories는 현재 시점의 registry 결과이므로 패키지 업데이트 후 재검증해야 한다.
- Route governance drift가 해결되기 전에는 endpoint map과 OpenAPI 산출물을 최종 계약으로 사용하면 안 된다.
